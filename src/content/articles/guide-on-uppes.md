## For NSFs

As I'm sure some of you guys here have been looking for answers on how to down/up PES, I figured that I would share my knowledge, as I was once as lost as you guys. 

To start off, I would like to address some misconceptions and questions about the PES status application.

When I was in kranji camp II BMT, my sergeants used to tell me to only apply for an up pes in unit as it is easier for the MO to keep you updated about your progress in the application. However this is **not true**. The medical database is linked across all SAF camps, and you can even call up your old medical centre and ask the person on the phone to transfer you to the MO, so that you can talk to him. Especially for those who really want to get out of the pes C/E life, do not waste any time to see the MO, as it would only mean you will get your pes status at a later date. 

Secondly, looking around Reddit and other discussion platforms, everyone says an up pes application usually takes between 2-6 months. This is only true to a certain extend, as many factors can come into play. There will be a monthly medical board meeting, and usually it would take only 1 month to get a new pes status if you time it correctly. However only the MO knows when the meeting is so do ask him. If you do miss the date then you just have to wait for the next month's meeting.

Also, it depends on the severity of your condition. The MO has a medical bible, where inside are all the criteria to up/down pes. If your condition meets the criteria to up pes, and together with a specialist memo, you will be more or less guaranteed a new pes status of B1 the day after the medical board meeting (do call up the medical centre to check with them) However, if your condition is like slightly off the requirements, the medical board might either accept or reject your application, or bring it up to the specialist board. This is where it takes about 6 months. The specialist board do not meet very regularly, and when they do, the MO will only know the meeting date about a week in advance. So depending on when you submit your pes status application and the severity of your condition, it takes about 1-6 months to get your new pes status.

### Steps

#### 1. Know your issue
Why are you currently given this pes status? Depending on your camp, you can either call them to book a slot for medical review, or do a walk in to see the MO. During your consultation, let the MO know that you are here because you want to up pes, and ask him how can you do it. Do let your incharge know that you want to go for a medical review so that they can bring you to the medical centre.

#### 2. Get a specialist memo. 
This specialist can either come from the private/government sector. You can always ask your MO to refer you to a government specialist, which would take around 2-3 weeks. However, private specialists usually have a lower criteria that you have to meet, and it would be much easier for them to write you a memo.

#### 3. Go back to the medical centre for another medical review, and pass your specialist memo to your MO
Afterwards, he will make you sign a form about your application, and the wheels would have started rolling. Do also ask him when the next medical board meeting is. Usually if its 1-3 weeks (in the same month) after you submit your application, your case will not make it to that month's meeting, so you have to wait for the next month's one.

#### 4. Wait for your new PES status

Call up the medical centre to ask them to help you check on your application status on **the day after** the medical board meeting (don't call on the day of the meeting as they will have no clue about the results). There can only be three scenarios:

- They tell you that you have been sucessful in your application. You will also get a text message and can now go to SAFhealth to see your new pes status.
- They tell you that your application is still processing. This means your case did not make it to that month's meeting, so just wait for the next month's one.
- They tell you that your case is being brought up to the specialist board. For this you just have to pray the next meeting is soon, because you can only wait for it, which is a very long time, especially now with the COVID-19 situation.

#### 5. Inform your superiors
Remember not to jump the chain of command. If you have already finished BMT (4 + 5 weeks) in Kranji Ccamp II and you are looking to recourse a combat BMT, do ask your superiors to talk to your unit S1/manpower about letting you recourse. Tell your superior to specifically to ask only the unit S1/manpower, as some of them dont know what to do and it would result in a longer waiting time. DISCLAIMER: I am not sure what happens if you successfully up pes during BMT.

*If you however want to remain at your old unit, you can just tell them and take take your yearly [IPPT](/ippt).*

For those who want to do a combat BMT and havent yet been enlisted, do call up CMPB to ask them for a medical review, its definitely much faster than you doing it after you enlisted already. Hopefully this guide is helpful and answers most of the questions you guys have about up PES!
