## Questions
### Should I get a haircut before enlisting?
Yes, you likely won't get much time to shower after the haircut in Tekong. Ask your barber for the "zero" cut, and remember to get it done not more than a day or two before enlistment. If your commanders think your hair is too long, you'll waste $2. 

Protip: make sure you are unable to pinch and pull your hair after the haircut. If you can, it's not short enough.

Check out the [BMT guide](/basic-military-training) for more information.

### What happens during the CMPB screening?
Just normal medical check-up stuff such as height, weight, urine and a blood draw. Bring any medical documents that you may thing is relevant such as those for pre-existing conditions. Also eat a meal before going so you don't feel dizzy after drawing blood. Try to style your hair a bit as your picture for your 11B will also be taken then.

### I'm enlisting at this time and this date. Is this a mono-intake?
Unfortunately, no one really knows. If you really want to ask, search for the "Enlistment" thread on the NS Subreddit. Do not create a new post, just look for the pinned post with the flair "Enlistment".

### Where can I see the packing guide?
You should receive the packing list from the MINDEF. Also check out the [BMT page](/basic-military-training), or ask a question on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG) if you have any doubts.

### What kind of spectacles are allowed?
Black plastic spectacles. Cannot be half-frame. 

If you need to buy a new pair, make sure the receipt is dated after your enlistment, and you can claim $40.

### I have this condition. Will I get a down PES?
Unfortunately, no one but an MO can give you a definite answer. All you can do is bring a specialist letter from an outside doctor. If you are in pain and want to down PES, tell your specialist.

### Going for field camp soon, what is it like? Anyone have any tips?
Yes, you're in luck. See the Field camp section of [BMT guide](/basic-military-training#field-camp).

### How to I guard my rifle in field camp?
- At night, clip the sling to your uniform's belt holes. That way, if anyone tries to lift it, it won't come off because it's connected to you. Also hug it when you sleep.
- Make sure it's never more than a meter away from you.

### I failed my IPPT. Can I still pass out of BMT?
To successfully pass out of BMT, the following are required:
- Pass 2 out of 3 of
  - IPPT (over 61 points)
  - BTP
  - Field camp

So if you fail your IPPT but pass field camp and BTP, you'll still POP. Note that in BMT, you will have 3 IPPT attempts (for enhanced PES A/B). Hand grenade and BIC are not requirements to POP.

### What are the requirements for command school
Check out the page for [command school](/command-school).

### Which vocation can will I get if I am PES A/B/C/E?
Again, no one can be completely sure. If you are combat-fit (PES A/B), expect a combat vocation like infantry. But combat-fit enlistees can also become transport operators, clerks, or storemen, so no one can be 100% sure.

Typically, lower PESes lie C to E get admin jobs (ASA/SA) or transport.

### Are PES Es and Fs second-class citizens?
**No**. People do not care about your PES unless you want to sign on and become a regular.

### Will NS affect my future/career?
No, no one outside NS cares about your rank or PES. This only matters if you want to sign on.

### Why can't I access NS.SG or the CMPB websites?
They go through scheduled maintenance every weekend.
