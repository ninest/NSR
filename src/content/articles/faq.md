## What happens during the CMPB screening?
Just normal medical check-up stuff such as height, weight, urine and a blood draw. Bring any medical documents that you may thing is relevant such as those for pre-existing conditions. Also eat a meal before going so you don't feel dizzy after drawing blood. Try to style your hair a bit as your picture for your 11B will also be taken then.

## I'm enlisting at this time and this date. Is this a mono-intake?
Unfortunately, no one really knows. If you really want to ask, search for the "Enlistment" thread on the NS Subreddit. Do not create a new post, just look for the pinned post with the flair "Enlistment".

## I have this condition. Will I get a down PES?
Unfortunately, no one but an MO can give you a definite answer. All you can do is bring a specialist letter from an outside doctor. If you are in pain and want to down PES, tell your specialist.

## Which vocation can will I get if I am PES A/B/C/E?
Again, no one can be completely sure. If you are combat-fit (PES A/B), expect a combat vocation like infantry. But combat-fit enlistees can also become transport operators, clerks, or storemen, so no one can be 100% sure.

## Are PES Es and Fs second-class citizens?
**No**. People do not care about your PES unless you want to sign on and become a regular.
