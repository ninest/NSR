The Specialist Cadet School (SCS) serves as the junior leadership school of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). It trains selected soldiers from all arms who demonstrate leadership potential to become specialists, equivalent to non-commissioned officers in other armed forces. SCS comprises three component schools (SCS I, SCS II, and SCS III) and operates under the Specialist and Warrant Officer Institute (SWI) at Pasir Laba Camp in the Western Water Catchment of Singapore

As part of SWI, SCS supports the institute’s mission to develop effective, dynamic, and committed Warrant Officers and Specialists with a proud identity anchored on shared values. The school upholds the motto “With Pride We Lead,” instilling in cadets the principles of loyalty, duty, respect, care, integrity, discipline, and excellence in all they undertake 

Upon graduating from Basic Military Training (BMT) at the Basic Military Training Centre, recruits who excel and exhibit leadership potential may be selected for Command School training at SCS. The selection process considers organisational needs, training performance, commanders’ recommendations, educational qualifications, and medical fitness. Selected cadets immediately assume the Specialist Cadet (SCT) rank for the duration of their specialist training. SCS comprises three schools, SCS I, SCS II, and SCS III, each organized into four companies, for a total of twelve companies. Command Teams in each company, supported by Subject Matter Experts from SWI Headquarters, plan and conduct the training syllabus to ensure consistency and high standards. Instructors include Regulars and National Servicemen who bring current operational experience to the programme

## Training phases

### Foundation Term (8 weeks)

Cadets acquire core infantry skills, weapon handling, tactical drills, fieldcraft, and develop basic leadership through classroom lessons and practical exercises. They conclude this phase with a 12 km route march in full battle order and obstacle challenges that test physical endurance and teamwork.

### Professional Term (13 weeks)

Cadets focus on vocation-specific training. Infantry and Guards specialists remain at SCS for advanced infantry leadership modules, while specialists in Armour, Artillery, Combat Engineers, Signals, Medical Corps, and other arms conduct equivalent training within their formation centres.

### Combined Arms Term (8 days)

Cadets integrate their skills in realistic, combined-arms scenarios, operating alongside different formations to reinforce inter-unit cooperation and battlefield leadership under simulated operational conditions.

## Next

At the end of the Combined Arms Term, cadets participate in a passing-out parade where they are promoted to Third Sergeant and assume leadership appointments in their units. Outstanding Third Sergeants may be selected for advanced courses, such as the Platoon Sergeant Course or crossover to the Officer Cadet School—to further enhance their leadership and tactical competencies 

Third Sergeants serve as section commanders and act as the vital link between commissioned officers and enlisted soldiers. They plan and conduct training, enforce standards of discipline, and look after their section’s welfare. As subject matter experts, they mentor recruits, supervise daily routines, and support operational planning at the platoon level under the guidance of platoon commanders and platoon sergeants
