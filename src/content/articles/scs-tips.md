## Before SCS

- Achieve Gold in your IPPT before reporting in. That award earns you longer daily admin breaks and can even secure early weekend bookouts during Found Term.
- Keep up interval training. SCS kicks off with demanding interval runs; adding uphill sprints to your routine will spare you agony later. 


## Admin time

- Use admin hours to plot your maps and prepare kit before dark
- Keep your living area and kit spotless, book out earlier!

## Gear and packing

- Always pack extra socks and tights. They reduce blisters and chafing on long marches or in dense jungle training
- Verify your LBS loadout and blank ammunition daily

## Company and welfare

- Research your companyâ€™s reputation before you start. Schools and companies vary widely in welfare levels, so speak to seniors or read up online to set realistic expectations. Always check Reddit
- Compared to BMT it turns more mentally and physically shag, yet you gain roughly two hours of admin daily

## Other

- Build trust within your section. Don't sabo anyone
- No bidets in the seated bowls. Prepare accordingly
