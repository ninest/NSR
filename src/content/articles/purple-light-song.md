I ask my girl
To take a walk
To take a walk
Down Orchard Road
Bypass Mandarin
To Centrepoint
Where we had lunch
At MacDonalds’

We had fillet
And an apple pie
We shared a cup
Of Lemon Lime
I held her hands
Looked into her eyes
I asked her to
Be my valentine

There was one night
There was no light
There was no light
So we used torchlight
Torchlight no light
So we used star light
Star light not bright
So we used Purple Light

Purple light
In the valley
That is where, I wanna be
Viper, best companions
(With my rifle and my buddy and me)

SOC, sibei jialat
[IPPT](/ippt), lagi worse
Every day, kena pumping
With my rifle and my buddy and me

Booking out, saw my girlfriend
Saw her with, another man
Scold the man, dump my girlfriend
(With my rifle and my buddy and me)

ORD, back to study
Get degree, so happy
Can’t forget, days in army
(With my rifle and my buddy and me)

Purple light
At the warfront
That is where, my buddy dies
If I die
Would you bury me?
(With my rifle and my buddy and me)
