## Allowed

- Black plastic, full-frame only. Solid black frames that fully encircle the lens. No metal, no flashy trims
- Clear, prescription lenses. Stick to standard, transparent lenses (no tints, no filters)

These will give you a claim of $40 if the receipt is **dated after enlistment**. Make sure you ask your S1 branch about this!

## Not allowed

- Half-rim or rimless frames
- Coloured or patterned arms (no logos either)
- Tinted lenses and sunglasses
- Dangly chains or big logos

When in doubt, just buy "birth control glasses"

Remember,

- Matte finish is the way to go. Prefer **non reflective** surfaces
- Bring a spares set
- Prefer avoiding contact lenses, at least for BMT
