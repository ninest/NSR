## Requirements
- Indicated interest for SCS/OCS.
- IPPT pass, but a higher score is better.
- Good general performance in BMT. 
- Good performance on SIT test
- Peer appraisal: section mates will "rate" you at towards the end of BMT based on what they think of you.

### SIT test
- The commanders will ask you if you want to go to SCS or OCS, and you have to indicate interest.
- Each task has two ICs, so you can show your interest by doing well when you are the IC.
- Stay ready as you can be ambushed at any time.
