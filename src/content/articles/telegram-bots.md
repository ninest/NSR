## Temperature taking bot
[t.me/temperature_ops_bot](https://t.me/temperature_ops_bot)

Skip the temptaking.ado.sg site and directly enter your temperature through Telgram. Features include
- reminders to enter temperature (two times per day)
- alerts when temptaking.ado.sg is down
- saving of name/pass, so you don't need to type it in every time

It's [open source](https://github.com/markus-lendermann/temperature-ops-bot).
