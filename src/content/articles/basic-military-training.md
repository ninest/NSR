## Enlistment tips

### Before enlistment
- Get a haircut prior to enlistment: you likely won't get much time to shower after the haircut in Tekong. Ask your barber for the "zero" cut, and remember to get it done not more than a day or two before enlistment. If your commanders think your hair is too long, you'll waste $2. Protip: make sure you are unable to pinch and pull your hair after the haircut. If you can, it's not short enough.
- Try to learn the difference between a *sergeant* and an *officer* (sir). If you see arrows on their rank (on their chest), it's most likely a *sergeant* or an *encik*.
- StarHub is usually the fastest service provider (for Tekong), followed by Singtel

### Packing guide
- Washing powder/liquid detergent
- Febreeze: note that febreeze is not a replacement to washing clothes. Please wash your clothes too
- Battery pack (around 40,000 mAh)
- Clothes hangers (at least 4-6)
- Underwears: bring around 2 more than you think you'll need. The darker the color, the better.
- Toilet roles: around 2 for the confinement period
- Wipeable marker: This makes it easier to clean the RAC card.
- 2 in 1 shower gel (the Nivea one is great)
- Coins (if they let you use the vending machines)
- Wet wipes/wet tissues (for area cleaning and boots polishing). Don't spend too much money on the expensive ones
- Nail clipper
- Dark colored spectacles
- Black watch: Only bring your watch if it's a dark color. No white watches.

## BMT tips
### Admin time

- Go for a shower either first, or last so you won't have to wait in line: If the line's already long, it *might* just be better to wait until your entire section is done. Until then, brush your teeth, defecate, fold your smart 4, and kiwi your boots.
- Take short showers and don't wear clothes in the cubicle: No more than 5 minutes unless you want your section mates to hate you.
- Don't shit in the shower
- Always keep at least one uniform in smart 4
- Enter the first 2 numbers on your lock before leaving your bunk: This way, you can open your lock the fastest and be the first one to take a shower.
- Bring extra food to share: Make friends faster!

### Area cleaning
- Use wet wipes
- Know that there is no way to "win": Even if you've cleaned every corner, your sergeants will find dust.
- Area cleaning on a day other than bookout day is usually admin time in disguise

### Other tips
- Check out the page on [commands](/commands) if you're having trouble remembering them.
- Your sergeants are real people too: If they're shouting at you, remember that they've been trained to do so. They are most likely NSFs waiting to ORD too.
- DO NOT SIGN ON THE LINES
