## Enlistment tips
- Get a haircut prior to enlistment: you won't get much time to shower after the haircut in Tekong

### Packing guide
- Washing powder/liquid detergent: in BMT, no washing machines provided.
- Febreeze: useful as there is very little time to wash.
- Battery pack (around 40,000 mAh)
- Clothes hangers (at least 4-6)
- Underwears: bring around 3 more than you think you'll need. The darker the color, the better.
- Toilet roles: 2 should be enough for the confinement period.
- Wipeable marker: This makes it easier to clean the RAC card.
- 2 in 1 shower gel (the Nivea one is great)
- Coins (if they let you use the vending machines)
- Wet wipes/wet tissues (for area cleaning and boots polishing)
- Nail cutter
- Dark colored spectacles
- Black watch: Only bring your watch if it's a dark color. No white watches.

## BMT tips
### Lectures
- Drink water every few minutes so you don't fall off asleep

### Admin time

- Go for a shower either first, or last so you won't have to wait in line: If the line's already long, it *might* just be better to wait until your entire section is done. Until then, brush your teeth, defecate, fold your smart 4, and kiwi your boots.
- Take short showers: No more than 5 minutes unless you want your section mates to hate you.
- Properly hook you tower and underwear inside the shower cubicle: You don't want them to fall in a puddle of soapy water.
- Don't wear clothes other than underwear inside the cubicle: Again, your section mates will hate your for this.
- Alway defecate before showering
- Always keep at least one shirt in smart 4
- Enter the first 2 numbers on your lock before leaving your bunk: This way, you can open your lock the fastest and be the first one to take a shower.
- Do some light stretching in once you're in bed
- Bring extra food to share: Make friends faster!

### Area cleaning
- Use wet wipes
- Line up all your boots and shoes
- Know that there is no way to "win": Even if you've cleaned every corner, your sergeants will find dust.
- Area cleaning on a day other than bookout day is usually admin time in disguise

### Other tips
- Your sergeants are real people too: If they're shouting at you, remember that they've been trained to do so. They are most likely NSFs waiting to ORD too.
- DO NOT SIGN ON THE LINES
