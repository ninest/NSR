They say that in the army, the food is very nice
You ask for curry chicken, they give you chao ta rice
I don’t wanna live an army life ya
I just wanna live a simple life ya

They say that in the army, the sergeants very nice
You ask for early book out, they tell you drop down 5
I don’t wanna live an army life ya
I just wanna live a simple life ya

They say that in the army, the rifles very nice
But when you pull the trigger, the bullet fly behind
I don’t wanna live an army life ya
I just wanna live a simple life ya

They say that in the army, the pay is very fine
They give you hundred dollars, then take back ninety-nine
I don’t wanna live an army life ya
I just wanna live a simple life ya
