## Infantry Song

We are the bedrock of our army
One thing to keep our people free
Committed to the independence of our nation
We are the men from the infantry

There will never be a mountain too high
Or a route too rough for us
We are about to rule the day and the darkest night
We will never rest till the wrong is right

From the land, air and sea
We will strike our enemies
They have called us the queen of the battlefield

We are brothers in arms
We are brothers proud to be
We are the first, the one and only infantry

We are a special band of soldiers
Raised to guard our nation's shores
We based our lives upon a set of 8 values
To defend our nation's cause

And when our country says she needs us
We are always there by her side
We will protect the lives of every Singaporean
For Singapore we will give our lives!

## BMT Roar

_We are the warriors of the SAF_
_Spirit of the bayonet in our blood_
_Brothers in arms, comrades for life_
_Against all odds, we will strive._
_BMT will thrash you AR, crush you AR_
_BMT will beat you AR, toughen you AR_

**Roar!**

_Excel! Through basics!_
_Excel! Through basics!_

## Training To Be Soldiers

Training to be soldiers
Fight for our land
Once in our lives
Two years of our time

Have you ever wondered?
Why must we serve?
Because we love our land
And we want it to be free to be free yeah!

Looking all around us
People everywhere
Children having fun
While we are holding guns

Stand up
Be on your guard
Come on everybody
Do your part
Come on every soldier
Soul and heart
Do it for our nation
Do it for our Singapore

## Left Toe Right Toe

Left toe right toe, keep up the tempo
Left toe right toe, way-loh way-loh ah

Here we go again
Same old march again
Up and down this avenue
X more days and we’ll be through

X more days to book out day
Book out book out day
Way-loh way-loh way-loh way-loh, ah ah
Way-loh way-loh way-loh way-loh, ooh ah ah

Up the hill
Down the slope
Up the slope

Any sweat?
No sweat, chicken feet ha ha
All the way

## When The Whistle Blows

When the whistle blows
Silence everywhere
And the flag goes up
In the battalion square

Soldiers all around
Never let you down
‘Cos we are the best
In the SAF

So echo echo out loud
Viper warriors never let you down yah
So echo echo out loud
Viper warriors never let you down yah

Up in the sky
Where the planes fly high
And the parachutes bloom
Like flowers in the sky

I wanna be
A Viper Coy! warrior
‘Cos we are the best
In the SAF

## Purple Light

Purple light, in the valley
That is where, I want to be
Viper Coy, best companions
With my rifle and my buddy and me

SOC, si bei jia lat
[IPPT](/ippt), lagi worse
Every day, doing PT
With my rifle and my buddy and me

Booking out, saw my girlfriend
Saw her with, another man
Scold the man, dump my girlfriend
With my rifle and my buddy and me

ORD, back to study
Get degree, so happy
Can’t forget, days in army
With my rifle and my buddy and me

Purple light, at the warfront
That is where, my buddy died
If i died, would you bury me?
With my rifle and my buddy and me

## Army Life

They say that in the army, the food is very nice
You ask for curry chicken, they give you chao ta rice
_I don't want to live an army life yah._
_I just want to live a simple life yah_

They say that in the army, the sergeant very nice
you ask for early book out, they tell you drop down 5
_I don't want to live an army life yah._
_I just want to live a simple life yah_

They say that in the army, the rifles very nice
But when you pull the trigger, the bullet fly behind
_I don't want to live an army life yah._
_I just want to live a simple life yah_

They say that in the army, the grenades very nice
But when you throw the grenade, your PC fly behind
_I don't want to live an army life yah._
_I just want to live a simple life yah_

## Cold Wind

In the early morning march
With a fieldback on my back
And an aching in my heart
And my body full of sweat

I'm a long long way from home
And I miss my mama so

In the early morning march
_When the cold wind blows_
_When the cold wind blows_
_When the cold wind blows_
_When the cold wind blows_

I know I know
You have to go
So hurry back home
I miss you so

## C-130

C130 rolling down the street
Viper warriors took a little trip
Stand up, hook it up, shuffle to the door
Jump right out by the count of four

Oh wa eh ya
Left right eh ya
Oh wa eh ya
Viper eh ya

If my shoot doesn’t open wide
I got a spare one by my side
If that one doesn’t open too
Oh hard ground I am coming for you

If I land in the Russian Front
Bury me with a Russian gun
If I land in the Vietnam War
Send me back to Singapore

If I land in Sentosa,
Send me back by cable car
If I land in the Old Folk’s Home
Pack me up and send me home

Tell my mom I’ve done my best
Now its time for me to rest
Tell my girl I’ve done my best
Silver wings upon my chest.

## I Ask My Girl

I ask my girl
To take a Walk
To take a Walk
Down Orchard Road
Bypass Mandarin
To Centrepoint
Where we had lunch
At MacDonalds'

We had fillet
And an apple pie
We shared a cup
Of Lemon Lime
I held her hands (Holding her hands)
Look into her eyes
I asked her to
Be my valentine (Be my future wife)

There was one night
There was no light
There was no light
So we used torchlight
Torchlight no light
So we used star light
Star light not bright
_So we used Purple Light_

## _Hentak Kaki_

Count by the count by the left foot count yah

One! Can’t hear your ah!
Two! Shout louder ah!
Three! Much better ah!
Four! All together now!

One! Two! Three! Four!

We come from a company
Famous in BMT
Come from a very special company

Fight for our glory
Fight for our victory
Fight with a spirit never seen before

Viper Coy! Viper Coy! all the way
We like it here we like it here
We found ourselves a home
A home, a home sweet home
