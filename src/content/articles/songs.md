In the valley\
There is where\
I want to be\
Infantry\
Close Companion\
With my rifle and my buddy and me ...

## Army Life
They say that in the army, the food is very nice\
You ask for curry chicken, they give you chao ta rice\
*I don't want to live an army life yah.*\
*I just want to live a simple life yah*

They say that in the army, the sergeant very nice\
you ask for early book out, they tell you drop down 5\
*I don't want to live an army life yah.* \
*I just want to live a simple life yah*

They say that in the army, the rifles very nice\
But when you pull the trigger, the bullet fly behind\
*I don't want to live an army life yah.* \
*I just want to live a simple life yah*

They say that in the army, the grenades very nice\
But when you throw the grenade, your PC fly behind\
*I don't want to live an army life yah.* \
*I just want to live a simple life yah*

## Airborne
A is for Airborne\
I is for in the sky\
R is for rough and tough\
B is for born to fly\
O is for on the go\
R is for ready\
N is for never quit\
E is for everything

Down by the river\
Took a little walk\
Ran into some terrorist\
Had a little talk

We push them YAH!\
We Kick them YAH!\
We push them kick them YAH YAH!\
Into to the river\
Left them to drown

We don't need no terrorist\
Hanging around

# Cold Wind
In the early morning march\
With a fieldback on my back\
And an aching in my heart\
And my body full of sweat

I'm a long long way from home\
And I miss my mama so

In the early morning march\
*When the cold wind blows*\
*When the cold wind blows*\
*When the cold wind blows*\
*When the cold wind blows*

I know I know\
You have to go\
So hurry back home\
I miss you so

## I Ask My Girl

I ask my girl\
To take a Walk\
To take a Walk\
Down Orchard Road\
Bypass Mandarin\
To Centrepoint\
Where we had lunch\
At MacDonalds'

We had fillet\
And an apple pie\
We shared a cup\
Of Lemon Lime\
I held her hands (Holding her hands)\
Look into her eyes\
I asked her to\
Be my valentine (Be my future wife)

There was one night\
There was no light\
There was no light\
So we used torchlight\
Torchlight no light\
So we used star light\
Star light not bright\
*So we used Purple Light*
