We are the bedrock of our army
One thing to keep our people free
Committed to the independence of our nation
We are the men from the infantry

There will never be a mountain too high
Or a route too rough for us
We are about to rule the day and the darkest night
We will never rest till the wrong is right

From the land, air, and sea
We will strike our enemies
They have called us the queen of the battlefield

We are brothers in arms
We are brothers proud to be
We are the first, the one and only infantry

We are a special band of soldiers
Raised to guard our nation’s shores
We based our lives upon a set of 8 values
To defend our nation’s cause

And when our country says she needs us
We are always there by her side
We will protect the lives of every Singaporean
For Singapore we will give our lives!
