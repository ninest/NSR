## Licence
The best thing about being a driver is that you get a [driving licence](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/web/portal/mindef/news-and-events/latest-releases/article-detail/2018/january/02jan18-mq-001/!ut/p/z0/fY25DsIwEES_hcKltZuIqw1QAOIqAjJu0AoWMCQbkpjr7zGIioJuZjQzDywYsEI3dyDvCqEs-LVtbzrzQX-IzXg2b6URJqs0nbR6s9Gy04Yx2P-F8BBX0_70APZC_qid7AswMUZdMCeSK1VPMBgHGXV1XmrE6L1xp7K0CdhtIZ4fHkzuZMd7_fHiFR6LnBUK32tNstN8C2mtMCPPtdcVZ0w1h-BNUvglKfwhXc52vZgkjReZvMqZ/) at the end of the 2 years, that is, if you clock 4000 km.

## Transport Operator

All NSFs who get posted to transport will first attend the 3-week **UIP**, after which they will get posted to a **transport node**, where they will spend the rest of their NS life.


### UIP
Marching required, stay-in, and PT around twice a week. It ends with an IPPT.

**Bring an extra battery pack** as you will get much more admin time than you did in BMT.

### Unit

NSFs get posted to a unit (**transport node**) after the UIP. Transport units give **nights out** every Tuesday and Thursday. Once in unit, they will be put on the waitlist for the driving course.

Note that it can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 to enter the driving course. Try not to waste this [free time](/free-time).

### Driving course
The driving course is now **stay-in**, with nights out on Wednesdays (needs confirmation).

### Admin time

Transport operators get a good amount of admin time. On Mondays and Wednesdays, the last parade is usually from 5 to 5:30 PM.

Transport apprentices (those who haven't gone for the dirivng course) pretty much have nothing to do, so they will be free the entire time.
