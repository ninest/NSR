## Transport Operator

All NSFs who get posted to transport will first attend the 3-week **UIP**, after which they will get posted to a **transport node**, where they will spend the rest of their NS life.


### UIP

Certain training is done (removed to ensure no confidential information is leaked).

There's PT thrice a week, and an IPPT on the last week.

The UIP is **stay-in**, without nights out. Marching is required.

#### Tips
- **Bring an extra battery pack**: You will get much more admin time than you do in BMT.

### Unit

NSFs get posted to a unit (**transport node**) after the UIP. Transport units give **nights out** every Tuesday and Thursday. Once in unit, they will be put on the waitlist for the driving course.

#### Tips
- **Sound off if you're tired or sleepy before driving**

### Driving course
<!-- The driving course works on a slot-by-slot basis. If there are slots open, you will be sent for the driving course. There is always time between when you get posted to your unit and when you get a slot for your driving course. If you're lucky, you'll get the driving course within a month of your being posted, but be prepared to wait. Note that having pending medical issues, medical appointments, temporary down PES may delay your entry to the driving course. -->

The driving course is now **stay-in**, with nights out on Wednesdays (needs confirmation).

### Admin time

Transport operators get a good amount of admin time. On Mondays and Wednesdays, the last parade is usually from 5 to 5:30 PM.

Transport apprentices (those who haven't gone for the dirivng course) pretty much have nothing to do, so they will be free the entire time.

## Transport Supervisor

Before becoming a transport supervisor, there's more training for around 9 months.

### Unit

TSs don't drive much; they mostly manage details and logistics.
